SwiftUI Image Loader: Modern Concurrency Implementation
Project Overview
A professional implementation of asynchronous image loading in SwiftUI using Swift's modern concurrency model. This project demonstrates my expertise in building robust, maintainable iOS applications with clean architecture principles.Technical Highlights

Modern Swift Concurrency: Implemented using Swift's async/await pattern for efficient, readable asynchronous code without callback pyramids or complex completion handlers


MVVM Architecture: Clear separation between data services, business logic, and UI presentation layers for maintainable, testable code


Reactive UI Pattern: Leveraged Combine framework with @Published properties and ObservableObject to create a responsive, state-driven UI


Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling throughout the network stack with proper propagation and user-friendly fallbacks


SwiftUI Best Practices: Demonstrated efficient conditional rendering, proper state management, and SwiftUI view composition

Skills Demonstrated

Swift 5.5+ concurrency features (async/await, Task)
SwiftUI framework proficiency
UIKit integration with SwiftUI
Network request management
Image processing and display optimization
Clean code principles and software architecture
State management in declarative UI frameworks

Implementation Details
The application follows a three-tier architecture that showcases my understanding of software design principles:
Network Layer: Handles raw data fetching with proper error handling
Service Layer: Transforms data into application models
Presentation Layer: Manages UI state and presentation logic
